# Stackoverflow-MLM
This repository contains the files used for the first project of the class Machine Learning Models.
# Objective
Stackoverflow is a free to use, QA website where people can interact with fellow programmers and post their questions as well as answers. Therefore, the website is able to capture large amounts of data where we can create our own questions and as data scientists, be able to respond to them. For this specific instance, I decided to use machine learning in order to classify what programming language was being asked for, based on the related info about the question. You can checkout the presentation, the written report, and the Jupyter Notebook that contains all the relevant code and findings.
